Description:
	By "starpause" : A quick burst of mono, modulated square wave. It has low and high frequency
components so I wouldn\'t use it to replace a kick or a snare, it works
best for flair. Sculpted in LSDj on my GBA-SP.

Description:
	By "starpause" : A decaying, square wave, mono kick drum. The square wave is modulated so this is not a max-volume super flat/square kick.  A gabber bass drum with a little LSDj pulse channel flavor! Recorded from a GBA-SP. Mono!
